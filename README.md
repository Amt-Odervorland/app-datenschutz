# Legal Pages (GitHub Pages)

This folder contains a minimal static site for a German privacy policy (Datenschutzerklärung), built for GitHub Pages.

## Deploy
1. Create a new public repository (e.g., `acme-legal`).
2. Upload all files from this ZIP to the repo root (or the `docs/` folder if you prefer).
3. In **Settings → Pages**: Source = **Deploy from a branch**, Branch = `main`, Folder = `/root` (or `/docs`).
4. Open the public URL that GitHub shows.

## Customize
- Replace ACME data (company, address, email) in `index.html` and `impressum.html`.
- Add/adjust your 3rd-party services in section 4.
- Optional: Add your logo and tweak `assets/style.css`.
